            description: 'I begin this story in the depths of the big waters, the mother. There are many stories about the oceans and seas that make up the Caribbean. I hear it told that these waters were poured out from a gourd to connect all that rises from where two continental plates meet, including the islands of Borinkén. Some say the waters that connect us make Caribbean people kin. These stories and kinships are gifts as much as they are responsiblities. This is the story I, as a Boricua in diaspora, have come to believe.',

In Borinkén (PR), TEK is alive and well. But as more realtives are lost to death and displacement, our traditional conservation and care practices are at risk of theft and appropriation. </p> <br> <p> It is important then to support the work of those who make it possible for generations of Afro and Indigneous descendant communities to continue resilient and culturally rooted conservation practices. Three examples of islanders doing this land-based work include El Grito, Departamento de la Agricultura, and Para la Naturaleza. On the map to your left you will see the approxiamte area within which they work in the eastern and south eastern area of Borinkén. <p> <br> Keep scrolling for more. ',

Whereas settler colonial conservation is primarily concerned with flora and fauna, eco-cultural conservation is concerned with the intergenerational connections between Afro and Indigenous descendant peoples and their ecosystems and establishing those relationships as vital to conservation and climate mitigation long-term. For this project I focus primarily on forest mountain regions in part because of my ancestral connection and in part to continue effort to highlight the eco-cultural relationship between mountains and coastal ecologies. Conservation must address both; the survival of one is linked with the survival of the other. <br> This project is ongoing, so if you have any ideas, comments, or concerns please email me at dejesu16@msu.edu',

Nkwejong, like much of the Great Lakes region, is the contemporary and ancestral homelands of the Anishinaabeg peoples, the Confederacy of the People of the Three Fires. Like the Caribbean, it is a place forged of blood and violence, but also shaped by the survival of Indigenous and Black/Afro-descendant peoples. I, like many other Michigan State University students, are specially indebted (in a good way) to the Anishinaabeg peoples whose continual surivance in the face of settler colonialism, shapes the worlds and landscapes upon which MSU exists and that we learn and benefit from today. As an MSU instructor and student I am honored to work towards being in good relationship with Indigenous peoples of this place and I am honored work towards being a good prima-de-afuera to all my Caribbean cousins, human and more than human.',
